#+TITLE: RandomMatrixDistributions

A Julia package containing =Distribution.jl=-type specifications for various distributions arising from random matrix theory.

** Currently implemented distributions
   - =SpikedWishart=: Wishart distribution with spiked covariance (sampler for more than one spike implemented only for the real case. [1]
   - =Jacobi=: Random matrices of the form /E(E+H)^{-1} ./, where /E/ and /H/ are white Wisharts. [2]
   - =MarchenkoPastur=: Limiting empirical spectral density of a white Wishart matrix.
   - =Wachter=: Limiting empirical spectral density of /HE^{-1} ./

** Efficient samplers
   The function =randeigvals= efficiently samples from the distribution of eigenvalues of the implemented random matrix distributions. It does this by generating a tridiagonal or banded matrix with eigenvalue equal in distribution to the specified model.

** Examples
   An Jupyter notebook demonstrating all of the implemented eigenvalue samplers is provided in =/examples/eigenvalue-simulation.ipynb=.
